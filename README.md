# AlgorithmsFinalProject
Final project for Design and Analysis of Algorithms.  Implements and documents 4 algorithms.

Implementations of the algorithms are in files named p1.py, p2.py, p3.py, and p4.py

Test functions for each problem are provided with some options to modify them. Without changing anything
each file will produce visual output when run as a python script.
